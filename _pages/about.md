Hi there! I'm Jupiter, a fluffy and adorable Maine Coon born on April 26, 2021, in Russia. 

I traveled all the way to sunny California, US, before finally settling down with my wonderful mom, Summer, in Nashville, TN. 

I love basking in the sunlight, chasing after my favorite toys, and bringing joy and cuddles to my forever home. Life is purr-fect here, and I'm so happy to share my adventures with you!
